#Git

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

The Zivtech Vagrant Development VM uses Git as it's version control system of choice. This is mainly because Git works better for larger teams of contributors and Drupal.org uses it now to manage version control of Drupal core and contributed project code.

##Using Git
Git is intuitive to use once you learn the commands. To view a list of all Git commands available to your Git installation, just type `git`.

##Git Commands
You will probably use some commands much more than others, but if you are unfamiliar with Git, it is probably best to read more about Git from the [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc).
