#Redis

[Redis](http://redis.io/) is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker.

Redis is installed by default in the Zivtech Vagrant Development VM to allow for caching on Drupal sites, as well as being able to be used as a database for other web applications.
