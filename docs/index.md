#Vagrant Development Virtual Machine

This Vagrant Development VM is a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) project that was developed by [Zivtech](https://www.zivtech.com/) to build a local virtual machine in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for developing websites and web applications.

The Zivtech Vagrant Development VM sets up a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) web server stack that is configured out of the box to start building websites and other web applications immediately with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control. The VM was originally built to develop Drupal websites on a local machine, but can be used to build many types of websites and web applications. [Pull Requests](https://github.com/zivtech/vagrant-development-vm/pulls) are welcome!
